                        <p>Zimmerman's musical "stage name", Deadmau5 (pronounced "dead mouse"), was inspired by the carcass of a frozen rodent that he found in a computer he'd constructed. He adopted a helmet/mask to support the name, with the famed accessory
                            having a variety of looks and incarnations.</p>
