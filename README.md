# Deadmu5
Milestone Project One: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute
This Website was designed for the fans of world famous DJ, Deadmau5. My aim for the website was to build it around users looking for information or updates on the DJ. The page highlights his newest music, some background information on the DJ, a way to get in contact  and what's coming up for the DJ in 2019.


A live version can be found on [Github Pages](https://chrisoc19.github.io/bandproject/)

# UX
When I was laying out this project, I wanted to make it as simple as possible. I choose to design diffrent pages with links to each page, over the one page layout as in my opinion looks better. 

As a user of the site, I want to be able to see pictures of the band and get more information about them.
As a user of the site, I would like to be able to find links to the djs social media .
As a user of the site, I would like to be able to listen to his songs find infromation on his upcoming tour.
As a client, I would like to be able to hear his music and a way to contact and  check foravailability.
I mocked up an early desktop-first layout using Balsamiq, which can be found [here](https://balsamiq.cloud/snckoo2/p15ebfw/r57E)

# Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.
HTML - Used for the structural elements of the site

CSS - Used to style the HTML elements

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)- Used for icons- Facebook, Twitter,Youtube, Instagram. 

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)- Used to give access to a multitude of helper classes for CSS

Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
