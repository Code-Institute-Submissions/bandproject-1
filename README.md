Milestone Project One: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute
This Website was designed for the fans of world famous DJ, Deadmau5. My aim for the website was to build it around users looking for information or updates on the DJ. The page highlights his newest music, some background information on the DJ, a way to get in contact  and what's coming up for the DJ in 2019.


A live version can be found on [Github Pages](https://chrisoc19.github.io/bandproject/)

# UX
When I was laying out this project, I wanted to make it as simple as possible. I choose to design diffrent pages with links to each page, over the one page layout as in my opinion looks better. 

As a user of the site, I want to be able to see pictures of the band and get more information about them.
As a user of the site, I would like to be able to find links to the djs social media .
As a user of the site, I would like to be able to listen to his songs find infromation on his upcoming tour.
As a client, I would like to be able to hear his music and a way to contact and  check foravailability.
I mocked up an early desktop-first layout using Balsamiq, which can be found [here](https://balsamiq.cloud/snckoo2/p15ebfw/r57E)

# Technologies Used

[jQuery](https://jquery.com/)-Used for DOM manipulation

# Testing
Carousel - I had issues with carousel with first use as was place outside of the main div. I moved it into the main div and this effected the background color of my iframe spoify section which I fixed by changing the background color behind the carousel to the same as the iframe Spotify.


Go to the "Home" page
Try an view all images in carousel. 
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.



Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
