Milestone Project One: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute
This Website was designed for the fans of world famous DJ, Deadmau5. My aim for the website was to build it around users looking for information or updates on the DJ. The site highlights his newest music, some background information on the DJ, a way to get in contact  and what's coming up for the DJ in 2019.


A live version can be found on [Github Pages](https://chrisoc19.github.io/bandproject/)

# UX
When I was laying out this project, I wanted to make it as simple as possible. I choose to design diffrent pages with links to each page, over the one page layout as in my opinion looks better. 

As a user of the site, I want to be able to see pictures of the band and get more information about them.
As a user of the site, I would like to be able to find links to the djs social media .
As a user of the site, I would like to be able to listen to his songs find infromation on his upcoming tour.
As a client, I would like to be able to hear his music and a way to contact and  check foravailability.
I mocked up an early desktop-first layout using Balsamiq, which can be found [here](https://balsamiq.cloud/snckoo2/p15ebfw/r57E)

# Features

# Technologies Used
- Html - Used for the structural elements of the site.
- CSS - Used to style the HTML elements.

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)- Used to give access to a multitude of helper classes for CSS

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)- Used for icons- Facebook, Twitter,Youtube, Instagram. 

- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)-Used for DOM manipulation

# Testing
- We  provided an audio and video sections, where a samples of the Djs work is available to listen to or watch. Works across all screens. Needed to remove a set width from Spotify section so would meet  basic responsiveness requirements.
- About Text was disproportionately large had to style seperatly.
- In gallery the images expand when mouse is hovered over them, images need to be clicked on for effect to work on smaller screens.
-  a contact form was added, where clients can get in contact. Contact form isnt linked with anything. Had issues with spacing around submit button.
- Any Links to outside sources i.e icons and social links will open a new tab.
- nav-bar fits full width on large screens and changes to a dropdown menu for smaller screens.all links function. 
- Footer I had a white space under my footer that with some help from slack got rid of by giving the conatiner-footer a bottom margin or -16px
-  I also checked the mobile view on my personal iphone7.
